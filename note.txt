Module 2 - JAVASCRIPT
-----------------------------

Features 
    - it can be used in both front end and backend
    - in front end - js provide behavior
    - in backend - js hepls in logical operations
    - Js support both procedural and object oriented programming(oops)
    - its a dinamically tight language - datatype changes during runtime.
    - single thread programming language, - Line by line execution.
    
Backend Procedural programming
--------------------------------

how to create a file.
---------------------------
    - filename.js
    - node - environment to run js outside the browser.

Display a content
------------------
console.log(content)

How to run
-----
node filename.js

to change directory: cd directoryname

Datatypes

Two types of datatype
1.Primitive Data types - cannot be changes 
                        - but can be reassigned.

                        x = 'hello'....canot be changed inside the same variable.
                        x='helo'
    -string - sequence of characters,single quotes or double quotes
    -number - 
    -boolean    - true or false
    -undefined - variable created but not assigned value.
    -null       - intentional absence of value. x = null.
    -bigint     -   lrger numbers eg:2^53
    -symbol     -  identify uniquely - eg : uses while creating js libraries - symbol()

2.Non primitive - combination of primitive data type - 
    -object - should be stored as key value pairs
    eg - object , array, functions.

variables
---------
used to store data
syntax
    variable - value
variable name is case sensitive.
rules to create variable name - identifiers.
---------------------------------------------
1.variable name should not start with digit.
2.subsequent characters can be alaphabeets ,digits,special characters.
3.if there is more than one word in variable name
        - camel case - eg carName.
        - words can be separated by underscores.
                eg:car_name...snake case

                extra(cases)
                -----
                camel case-carName.
                pascal case-CarName.
                snake case - car_name.
                kabab case- car-name.
                train case- Car-Name.
                upper snake case - CAR_NAME.
                flat case - carname.
                dot case - car.name
            js cases 
            ---------
            flat case
            camel case
            snake case.

keyword(important)
-----------
reserved words
it gives special meaning to the variables

    1.let - reassigning possible.
            redeclaration is not possible.
            hoisting not possible.
            block level scope.
                -only within curly braces.
    2.const - no reassigning is possible
                redeclaration is not possible.
                hoisting not possible
                global scope.not within loop because the value will changed in loop.
    3.var - reassigning is possible.
            redeaclaration is possible.
            hoisting possible.
            global scope.

Hoisting (interview)
--------------------
using a variable before it is declared.
only for var.
    result will be shown as undefined

concatenate.(imp)
----------------
(adding) appending one or more data types
number + number = number
string + number = string
string + string = string

template literal
-----------------
its a way of displaying content.

context $(variable)

Operators
------------
1.Assignment Operators
    represented by =
    eg:x=10.
2.Arithmatic operators
------------
addition +
subtraction -
multiolication  *
division /
modulous %
exponential **

3.Relational Operators
    >(greater than)
    >= (greater than or equal to) 
    < (less than) 
    =<(less than or equal to) 
    ==(double equal to)  
    ===(triple equal to)

    -relational operators return boolean value

4.Logical operators
--------------------
used in between relational operators
returns boolean values

AND (&&) 
T && T = T
T && F = F
F && T = F
F && F = F

OR (||)

T || T = T
T || F = T 
F || T = T
F || F = F

NOT (!)


5.increment(++) or decrement(--) operators
x++
x--

6.shorthand operator

+=   x =x+10;
-=   x= x-10

7.ternary operator
condition?truestatemnt:falsestatemnt;

8.truthy operator
    if there is only one statement or one if use truthy
    condition && statement (can be also used in react)

conditional statemnets or decesion make statemnets
to conditionally execute a statemnets
if else
    syntax
    -------
    if(condition){
        statements;
    }

switch case

Looping statement
---------------------
-to execute a statement repeatedly in a  rpogramme file
-Once control enters the loop - exit is only possible when condition is false.
1.while

syntax
--------
variable initialization
while(condition){ //number of times the loop should execute.
    statements
    exit condition // increment or decrement condition.
}

2.for

for(variable_initialization;condition;exit/incr/decre statement){
    statements.
}
cubes from 1 to 10:1 8 27 64 125 216 343 512 729 1000
squares from1 to 10:1 4 9 16 25 36 49 64 81 100
->Break statement - To exit forcefully from a loop.we use break statement

concepts
num/10 : add a decimal before the last digit
num%10 : will give last digit as remainder
num*10 : add zero to last once place

factorial : product of numbers ranging from 1 to given number

armstrong: 153 - 1**3 + 5**3 + 3**3

to access individula digits from given numbers
lastdig = num%10
num = Math.floor(num/10) -  to get remaining digit.

prime numbers- those natural numbers which have two factors that is 1 and the number itself.

natural umbers - 1,2,3...
whole numbers - 0,1,2,3
integers - -ve to positive  -2,-1,0,1,2,3

functions
-------------
-   to execute a set of code repeatedly at DIFFERENT LOCATION OF THE programming.
two part of functions
-   function definition
        place a set of code that need to be executed.
        syntax 
            function fname{
                statement;
            }
-   function call
     -to execute the  code
        syntax
            fname() 

    functions are used to avoid Boiler plate(same set of codes repeating agin and again)
